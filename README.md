# MusicML
Final project for scalable machine learning class. Based on Transformer machine learning model.

## Setup
First create a virtual environment inside the root of your cloned repository.

### For Windows
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Then, activate your virtual Python environment. This is showing the PowerShell activation script.
There are other scripts for Bash and Windows Command Prompt.

```
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### For Mac
Python 3 already ships virtualenv, but if itâ€™s not installed in your environment for some reason, you can install it via the package for your operating systems, otherwise you can install from pip:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
You can create and activate a virtualenv by:
```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

Next, install this repository's pip requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, install PyTorch. This is how to install it for Python 3.7 on Windows with CUDA support.

```
pip install torch===1.3.1 torchvision===0.4.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
Or isntall it using Anaconda on Mac
```
conda install pytorch===1.3.1 torchvision===0.4.2 -c pytorch
```

## Scripts
The mha.py script demonstrates the multihead attention mechanism described in Vaswani et al. paper
_Attention Is All You Need_.


## Dataset
The project levages [The MAESTRO Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro) for trainning purpose.
